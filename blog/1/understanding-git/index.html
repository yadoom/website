            When I launched this site, I created a placeholder for a Github. I was weighing options between different Git solutions. This is my conclusion, at least for now.<br><br> 

            The #1 issue I had was how to deal with projects done as coursework. I've had projects in some of my courses that were incredibly fun and demonstrated interesting CS concepts, and they are well designed assignments.<br><br> 
            
            Although worthy of being public, these assignments cannot be because they are assigned to other students with perhaps only slight variations, if any. The challenge is the whole point of doing these assignments, so exposing them isn't fair to professors or students.<br><br>
            
            I considered private self hosting with GitLab. Long story short, I can't use the UW web server since I only have 1GB. I could use a <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-gitlab/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> with an external drive to run a GitLab server at 
            home and portforward, but then I would need to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS" target="_blank">Dynamic DNS service</a> like No-IP to deal with my dynamic IP. This is doable, but time consuming since it would be my first self hosted Git server 
            with software I've never used before.<br><br>
            
            With my limited time, I have a few free spots inbetween quarters to get more practice.<br><br>
            
            <a href="../../../fun/" target="_blank">Spectrum and Hanoi</a> qualify, but Spectrum uses a deprecated RGB LED library and needs to be updated and polished.<br><br>
            
            I could polish up those two and make a new third project and host them on Github. For now, though, I think it would be optimal to spend time practicing code problems on LeetCode or Hackerrank instead. 
            As I learn new skills, I can eventually go for quality over quantity when it comes to open projects.<br><br>
