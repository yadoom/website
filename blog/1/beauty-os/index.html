            I'm currently taking CSS 430, Operating Systems, and it's a ton of fun. Prior to this I had plenty of experience with various Linux distros and only knew the raw basics of processes and threads, 
            but now I've discovered a new appreciation for the operating systems we interact with each day.<br><br>
            
            From the <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/css430/" target="_blank">course catalog</a>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This course introduces the logical design of operating systems, especially focusing on the design in Java. Topics covered include processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, deadlocks,
                memory management, virtual memory, file systems, I/O systems, network programming, protection, and security used in the popular desktop and real-time operating systems. Through the course, we will
                use Java to illustrate many operating-system concepts. Using Java, you will implement each concept of process management, memory management, and file system.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="lead">
            <br><br>So far we've completed two projects.<br><br>
            
            The first was a simple exercise using a pipe to practice making unix system calls and doing some basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication" target="_blank">IPC</a>. This was accomplished with a single C++ file, 
            which when running is (ofcourse) a process. It uses <code>fork</code> to birth a duplicate child process, which will run along side the parent with the program counter set to right after the fork call.<br><br>
            
            From there, its a matter of using the process id returned from <code>fork</code> and setting up an if/else block. The parent will always wait for its child to respond with the goodies (its output), and children overwrite their process image with a new one using
            <code>execlp</code> from the same header as fork. Each pipe has its unused file descriptors closed and its useful ones remapped from <code>STDIN</code> or <code>STDOUT</code> using <code>dup2</code> if applicable:
        </p>

<pre class="pre-scrollable">
<code>#include ...</code>
<code>...</code>
<code></code>
<code>int main(int argc, char ** argv) {</code>
<code>         ...</code>
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">          // open a pair of file descriptors for each side of pipe</code> 
<code>          enum { R, W };</code>
<code>          int fd[2];</code>
<code>         if(pipe(fdA) < 0) perror("*Error in creating first pipe!");</code>
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">         // fork a child, ensure success</code>
<code>         if(forkcheck((pid = fork()) < 0)) return EXIT_FAILURE;</code>
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">         // in child process</code>
<code>         else if(pid == 0) {</code>
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">              // close unused side of pipe (R/W), as appropriate</code>
<code>              close(fd[...]);</code> 
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">              // map one side of pipe (R/W) to STDIN or STDOUT</code>
<code>              dup2(fd[...], ...);</code> 
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">              // overwrite process image with desire command</code>
<code>              execlp("cmdPath", "cmd", "args", NULL);</code> 
<code></code>
<code>         }</code>
<code></code>
<code class="cmt">         // parent, wait for child response</code>
<code>         else wait(...);</code>
<code>}</code>
</pre>

        <p class="lead">
            Part II of this project was implementing the <code>&</code> and <code>;</code> delimiters in a simulated shell. Just like in bash, the ampersand will run a process without having bash wait on the process to exit. 
            The semicolon, however, enforces bash blocking. Our shell supports single commands and chains, with homogeneous delimiters or mixed.<br><br>
            
            The second project is a little more complicated. Our assignments in this course are based on something called <em>ThreadOS</em>, which is a Java-based program that simulates operating system functionality.
            The stock source for ThreadOS's thread scheduler was provided to us.<br><br>
            
            Our task was to create two variants, one implementing a strict
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling" target="_blank">Round Robin</a> policy and working up from there a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_feedback_queue" target="_blank">Multilevel Feedback Queue</a>. The logic to implement these was done largely in the
            <code>run()</code> method of each alternate scheduler java file, since scheduler (like most everything that works with ThreadOS) extends <em>Thread</em>.<br><br>

            With only two out of five projects down, I've already learned a decent amount about what goes on under the hood in typical day-to-day OS tasks. It's neat knowing that ideas like these are implemented and running when
            I do quick and simple things like pipe something through grep in my terminal or simply switch between apps on my phone. It reminds not to take such amazing technology for granted.<br><br>
