            Once a upon a time, linux boxes at my university's computer science lab were directly accessible via SSH. These machines were mapped to a URL on the universities web domain, so it wasn't necessary to be on the local network. 
            Then the admins changed the configs so that only UW IPs could reach the boxes.<br><br>
            
            This was a great security move. The admins updated the lab wiki with instructions on how to access the boxes outside the UW, by using F5 Networks' Big-IP client. In other words, a VPN that tunnels through UW and requires UW's 
            own NetID authentication through its web login protocol.<br><br>
            
            This was great except for a couple of issues. Sometimes, Big-IP would struggle to maintain a connection to the VPN and drop randomly -- other times no connection at all. Also, Big-IP has no convenient Linux solution and the wiki 
            offered nothing in that regard.<br><br>
            
            There's a <a href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_apm/manuals/product/apm-client-configuration-11-4-0/4.html" target="_blank">CLI version of Big-IP</a>, but just like with the GUI in Windows, connections can be unstable more frequently
            than what I would consider normal. Especially at night, probably when most students are logging in through UWs server. It must be used for more than just our lab on our campus.<br><br>
            
            Anyway, a solution I found that works incredibly well is simply using an SSH tunnel. I access UW's <em>vergil</em> web server, the server that this site is hosted on, and then using a remote shell simply SSH into UWB's lab. 
            It seems that the IP range is cross campus.<br><br>
            
            Rather than SSH into vergil and then SSH again into the lab, especially since I can't create bash aliases on vergil, I simply created an alias on my home machine to tunnel through vergil and hit the UWB lab using the standard addresses:
        </p>

        <div class="well"><code>ssh netid@vergil.u.washington.edu -L 3111:uw1-320-##.uwb.edu:22 -N -f</code></div>

        <p class="lead">
            <em>##</em> is just the particular machine ID (there are perhaps 10 to 12 boxes I believe). This command piggy backs on vergil by means of portforwarding. In this case, I'm using <code>-L</code> to bind local port 3111 
            (any unused port over 1024 should work) to the remote socket (the UWB lab).<br><br>
            
            <code>-N</code> indicates that no commands are to be executed directly from the call to SSH, but rather just maintain the portforwarding. <code>-f</code> puts the process in the background, allowing bash to return, after authentication. 
            From here, I simply put this in my <em>.bash-aliases</em> with my info as <code>tunnel</code>. Any time I want to hit the UW lab, I simply call my alias and close the terminal after authentication. Then I connect to my local port with the same uname:
        </p>

        <div class="well"><code>ssh netid@localhost -p 3111</code></div>

        <p class="lead">
            This works with sftp to transfer files as well, but I just use the GUI network folder feature in my file explorer.<br><br>
            
            A.
        </p>
    </div>
