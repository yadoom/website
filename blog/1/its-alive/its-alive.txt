Welcome. This is the first post in what I hope to be a series of posts regarding (mostly) technical topics
that I encounter every now and then.
              
In my time studying programming and the like, I hardly ever touched on anything web dev related. I decided to use 
some of the extra time I had this summer to read up on the magic of HTML and CSS.
              
The learning curve was about as steep as I expected. As with the handful of languages I've encountered, everything
seemed basically impossible at first. But I am getting the hang of it, and the good old feeling of turning code
into tangible results hasn't faded one bit.

This site is going to be a rolling work in progress. It's built to be an online portfolio, though it also doubles
as a test bed for me to build on my web dev skills when I'm not going full throttle on course curricula.

I've been toying with different color schemes. My mood nowadays seems to call for purple and pink.

If you're reading this and have suggestions, I definitely would like to hear about them at adamali@uw.edu.
