            Welcome. This is the first post in what I hope to be a series of posts regarding (mostly) technical topics that I encounter every now and then.<br><br>
            
            In my time studying programming and the like, I hardly ever touched on anything web dev related. I decided to use some of the extra time I had this summer to read up on the magic of HTML and CSS.<br><br>
            
            The learning curve was about as steep as I expected. As with the handful of languages I've encountered, everything seemed basically impossible at first. But I am getting the hang of it, and the good old feeling 
            of turning code into tangible results hasn't faded one bit.<br><br>
            
            This site is going to be a rolling work in progress. It's built to be an online portfolio, though it also doubles as a test bed for me to build on my web dev skills when I'm not going full throttle on course curricula.<br><br>
            
            I've been toying with different color schemes. My mood nowadays seems to call for purple and pink.<br><br>
            
            If you're reading this and have suggestions, I definitely would like to hear about them at <b>adamali@uw.edu</b>.<br><br>
            
            A.
