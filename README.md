# yadoom.github.io
A web portfolio. This on-going project is built on Bootstrap with raw HTML and CSS. That is, it doesn't make use of any content management systems or templates.

Originally it was a rough prototype to practice web development, but it started become more developed than intended and I decided to publish it.

The reason I am mirroring it here is for the Github name in the URL to list on resumes, so it would be more obvious I have a Github to begin with. It started out originally as an expirement on my university's student web server.

Generally, most pages are optimized for desktop and mobile displays. It's been tested by resizing my browser window mainly.
