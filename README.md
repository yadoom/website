# yadoom.github.io
A web portfolio. This on-going project is built on Bootstrap with raw HTML and CSS. That is, it doesn't make use of any content management systems or templates.

Originally it was a rough prototype to practice web development, but it started to become more developed than intended and I decided to publish it.

The reason I am mirroring it here is for the Github name in the URL to list on resumes, so it would be more obvious I have a Github to begin with. It started out originally as an expirement on my university's student web server.

Generally, most pages are optimized for desktop and mobile displays. It's been tested by resizing my browser window mainly.

# Google Analytics (Disclaimer)
I have a bit of JS on all of my pages that report usage analytics. It logs all kinds of information: usage dates/times/durations, user agents, IP addresses and so on. There's nothing particularly identifying, but I use it to get an idea of how many hits I'm getting when I send out resumes with my portfolio linked on them. It's also useful for determining what parts of it are most popular.

# Github Landing
The pulsing Github logo button on the home page leads to a portal for my Github. Since I have a lot of code from school projects I'd like to show case, I had to make them all private. In order to make them accessible for select viewers, I included a page that links to a Github login, which redirects to my profile after credentials to guest dummy collaborator are entered. I share the login on request.

# Blog
I make posts about once or twice a quarter as a rolling log of what's going on in my courses and what projects I'm working on. They also serve as part of the documentation for some of the projects.

I now consider this an official project and no longer something expiremental like it once was. 

If it isn't already obvious, I really like colors. Most of the hues and inspiration for the cycling banner are from http://clrs.cc/.
